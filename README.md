# Tuvel-Soundboard

This is a soundboard I made for the 9th year anniversary of Tuvel, which is the name of a group of very close friends.

Every year we have the habit of getting together to catch up, listen to music, play games and just have fun.

For this year I wanted a soundboard with memes that we could use to mess around with each other,
so there's a free domain you can visit and play the sounds on your phone or computer (https://tuvel-soundboard.herokuapp.com/)

I'll be adding more features such as favoriting audios, and separating them in categories for a neater look and feel.
